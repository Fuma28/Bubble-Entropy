# Bubble-Entropy
An academic project for the Biomedical Signal Processing course based on: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313464790_Bubble_Entropy_An_Entropy_Almost_Free_of_Parameters
---
In this repo you will find:
- An implementation of bubbleEntropy, Condition Rènyi Permutation Entropy, Rènyi Permutation entropy, Permutation Entropy
- 2 tests (*test_m* and *test_n*) to demonstarate the dependance of each method on the embedding dimension m and the lenght N of the timeserie
- 1 test (*test_p*) which demonstarates the discriminating power of bubbleEntropy for HRV
- 3 images with the expected results of the tests
- A small presentation on the topic

***N.B.*** the test use the wfdb-matlab package to access the Physionet dababase. See https://physionet.org/content/wfdb-matlab/0.10.0/ for more informations
